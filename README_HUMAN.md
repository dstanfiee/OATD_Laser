# Advanced_Packaging_Laser_Repository

This repository serves as a centralized location for storing and accessing scripts developed by engineers working on laser-related tools at Intel. Engineers are encouraged to contribute by submitting changes to existing scripts or adding new ones, following the guidelines outlined in this document and the additional resources available in the **docs/** directory.

The repository is managed using Git, a distributed version control system, which allows multiple engineers to collaborate on various interrelated projects simultaneously. To avoid conflicts, ensure that no one else is making divergent changes to the same project area at the same time, as this may result in overwritten changes during merges to the main branch. Refer to the `Git` section below for more details on distributed version control.

## Directory Structure:
At the time of launch, the repository relies on a straightforward directory structure that should be built on and expanded as new projects arise that are not covered by the following areas:
- **data_visualization/** → Scripts for data visualization tasks
- **statistical_analysis/** → Scripts for statistical analysis
- **state_machine_modeling/** → State machine implementations in Python, MATLAB, and JSL
- **data/** → Test Log files, SPC data, XML, and equipment-related datasets. **Note** any data that is designated Intel Top Secret (ITS) should not be stored in the **data/** directory. Ideally ITS content should be stored locally in a separate directory outside the cloned repository directory. If this is not feesible and ITS data is stored locally in the **data/** during development, ensure that you do not stage those changes made to the **data/** directory when committing a change to the main branch. See the `README.md` file in  `docs` for further discussion on designing scripts to allow for reading input data from a configurable local directory.
- **docs/** → Guides on language selection, workflows, onboarding.

Each function has subfolders for **Python, R, JSL, and MATLAB**. See individual README files for details.

## Guidelines for Deciding Where to Place New Scripts
1. **Identify the Functionality:**
   - Determine the primary purpose of the script (e.g., data visualization, statistical analysis, automation, state machine modeling).
2. **Select the Appropriate Directory:**
   - Place the script in the corresponding directory based on its functionality.
3. **Choose the Language Subfolder:**
   - Within the selected directory, choose the subfolder for the language you are using (Python, R, JSL, MATLAB).

## Guidelines for Choosing a Language
1. **Project Requirements:**
   - Consider the specific requirements of your project and the strengths of each language.
2. **Team Expertise:**
   - Choose a language that your team is most comfortable with and proficient in.
3. **Performance Considerations:**
   - Evaluate the performance needs of your project and select a language that meets those needs.

## Script Naming Conventions
1. **Descriptive Names:**
   - Use meaningful and descriptive names that reflect the script's functionality.
2. **Avoid Special Characters:**
   - Use only alphanumeric characters and underscores. Avoid spaces and special characters.
3. **Version Information:**
   - Include version information in the script header, not in the filename. Use a version control system like Git to manage versions.

## Header Information
1. **File-Level Comments:**
   - At the top of every file, include a header that outlines:
     - The purpose of the file.
     - An overview of its contents.
     - Any prerequisites or dependencies.
     - Version information (e.g., version number, date, author).

## Best Practices for Utilizing GitHub Copilot
1. **Clear Instructions:**
   - Provide clear and concise instructions to GitHub Copilot to get the best results.
2. **Review Generated Code:**
   - Always review the code generated by GitHub Copilot to ensure it meets your requirements and adheres to best practices.
3. **Refine and Iterate:**
   - Refine the generated code as needed and iterate on the instructions provided to GitHub Copilot for improved results.
