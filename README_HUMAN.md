# OATD_Laser Repository
This repository is for process engineers developing automation, state machine modeling, and statistical analysis tools.

## Directory Structure:
- **data_visualization/** → Scripts for data visualization tasks
- **statistical_analysis/** → Scripts for statistical analysis
- **automation/** → Scripts for automating processes
- **state_machine_modeling/** → State machine implementations in Python, MATLAB, and JSL
- **data/** → Log files, SPC data, XML, and equipment-related datasets
- **docs/** → Guides on language selection, workflows, onboarding, and state machine modeling.

Each function has subfolders for **Python, R, JSL, and MATLAB**. See individual README files for details.

## Guidelines for Deciding Where to Place New Scripts
1. **Identify the Functionality:**
   - Determine the primary purpose of the script (e.g., data visualization, statistical analysis, automation, state machine modeling).
2. **Select the Appropriate Directory:**
   - Place the script in the corresponding directory based on its functionality.
3. **Choose the Language Subfolder:**
   - Within the selected directory, choose the subfolder for the language you are using (Python, R, JSL, MATLAB).

## Guidelines for Choosing a Language
1. **Project Requirements:**
   - Consider the specific requirements of your project and the strengths of each language.
2. **Team Expertise:**
   - Choose a language that your team is most comfortable with and proficient in.
3. **Performance Considerations:**
   - Evaluate the performance needs of your project and select a language that meets those needs.

## Script Naming Conventions
1. **Descriptive Names:**
   - Use meaningful and descriptive names that reflect the script's functionality.
2. **Avoid Special Characters:**
   - Use only alphanumeric characters and underscores. Avoid spaces and special characters.
3. **Version Information:**
   - Include version information in the script header, not in the filename. Use a version control system like Git to manage versions.

## Header Information
1. **File-Level Comments:**
   - At the top of every file, include a header that outlines:
     - The purpose of the file.
     - An overview of its contents.
     - Any prerequisites or dependencies.
     - Version information (e.g., version number, date, author).

## Best Practices for Utilizing GitHub Copilot
1. **Clear Instructions:**
   - Provide clear and concise instructions to GitHub Copilot to get the best results.
2. **Review Generated Code:**
   - Always review the code generated by GitHub Copilot to ensure it meets your requirements and adheres to best practices.
3. **Refine and Iterate:**
   - Refine the generated code as needed and iterate on the instructions provided to GitHub Copilot for improved results.
