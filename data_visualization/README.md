# data_visualization Documentation

## Purpose
The `data_visualization` directory is intended for scripts and projects related to the human-interpretable, graphical representation of datasets. These projects aim to provide insights through visual means, making complex data easier to understand and analyze.

## Examples of Projects
1. **Wafer Map Visualization:**
   - Graphing a vector field of die coordinates on a wafer map (e.g., quiver plots).
2. **Flow Charts:**
   - Creating flow charts using tools like Mermaid to visualize the flow of information through a system or steps for a BKM (Best Known Method) overview.
3. **Statistical Plots:**
   - Generating histograms, scatter plots, or box plots to represent statistical data.
4. **Time-Series Analysis:**
   - Visualizing trends over time using line charts or area plots.

## Guidelines for Adding Scripts
1. **Focus on Visualization:**
   - Ensure the primary purpose of the script is to create visual representations of data.
2. **Use Appropriate Libraries:**
   - Leverage libraries or tools suited for visualization (e.g., Matplotlib, ggplot2, MATLAB plotting functions, or JSL visualization tools).
3. **Documentation:**
   - Include clear documentation and examples to explain the purpose and usage of the script.
4. **File Placement:**
   - Place the script in the appropriate subfolder based on the programming language (Python, R, MATLAB, JSL).
