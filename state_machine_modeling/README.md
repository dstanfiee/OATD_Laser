# State Machine Modeling Documentation

## What is a State Machine?

A state machine is a computational model used to design algorithms. It consists of a finite number of states, transitions between those states, and actions. State machines are used to model the behavior of systems that can be in one of a finite number of states at any given time.

## Usage of State Machines

State machines are widely used in various fields such as:

- **Embedded Systems**: To manage the states of hardware components.
- **Game Development**: To control the states of game characters and objects.
- **User Interfaces**: To manage the states of UI components.
- **Protocol Design**: To model communication protocols.

## Best Practices for Creating a State Machine in Python

1. **Define States as Classes**: Each state should be a class that inherits from a base state class.
2. **Implement State Transitions**: Each state class should implement an `on_event` method to handle state transitions.
3. **Use a State Machine Class**: Manage the current state and delegate events to the current state using a state machine class.
4. **Logging**: Use logging to track state transitions and events.
