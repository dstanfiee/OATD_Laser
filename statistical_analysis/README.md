## Guidelines for Creating Statistical Analysis

1. **Handling Sensitive Data**:
   - Input data that could be considered Intel Top Secret (ITS) **must not** be uploaded to the repository's main branch.
   - Store sensitive input data in a local file directory outside the cloned repository.
   - Use scripts or batch files to process the data locally without exposing it to the repository.

2. **Script Development**:
   - Scripts should be designed to read input data from a configurable local directory.
   - Avoid hardcoding file paths; use configuration files or environment variables to specify input/output directories.
   - Ensure scripts are well-documented with clear instructions for usage.

3. **Recommended Libraries and Languages**:
   - While not mandatory, the following libraries and languages are encouraged for consistency and ease of collaboration:
     - **Python**:
       - Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, `statsmodels`
     - **R**:
       - Libraries: `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `tidyr`, `caret`, `shiny`
     - **MATLAB**:
       - Built-in statistical and data visualization toolkits.
   - Ensure all dependencies are listed in a `requirements.txt` file (for Python) or equivalent for other languages.

4. **Version Control**:
   - Commit only non-sensitive scripts and documentation to the repository.
   - Use `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive data or temporary files from being tracked.

5. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Include test cases or example datasets (non-sensitive) to validate the functionality of the scripts.
   - Ensure reproducibility by documenting the steps to run the analysis.

## Directory Structure
- Organize scripts and documentation logically:
  ```
  statistical_analysis/
  ├── scripts/         # Analysis scripts (organized by the programming language used, e.g., Python, R, MATLAB)
  ├── tests/           # Test cases and example datasets
  ├── docs/            # Additional documentation
  └── README.md        # This file
  ```

## Contribution Guidelines
- Follow the above guidelines when contributing to this directory.
- Ensure all code is reviewed and approved before merging into the main branch.
